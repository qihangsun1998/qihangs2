From Summer 2024, I will be a postdoc at the University of Lille, in France. 

I get my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2024 at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of Professor [Scott Ahlgren]. 

I completed my bachelor in Mathematics in 2019 at Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in China.
