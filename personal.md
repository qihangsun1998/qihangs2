# Personal

I like to play chess in my spare time. This is the [link](https://www.chess.com/member/sqhby) to my page at chess.com.

I got Amateur 3 Dan in [Weiqi (围棋, Go)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) when I was 9 (this level of 3 Dan means... an intermediate amateur I guess :). 

In music I recommend Guzheng (古筝) and Guqin (古琴) as traditional Chinese instruments to listen. Here are the songs I like the most: [雪山春晓](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqtJPv3rYJk)；[潇湘水云](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IhLOR6jgVE)。
